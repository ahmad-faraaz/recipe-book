# Pumpkin pie recipe

A warm, spiced pumpkin pie with a flaky crust — perfect for fall and holiday desserts.

## Preparation

- Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
- Cut pumpkin or squash in half and remove seeds and strings.
- Bake cut-side down on a baking sheet for 45–60 minutes until tender.
- Scoop out flesh and puree until smooth (or use canned pumpkin).
- Use 2 cups (about 500g) of pumpkin puree for this recipe.

## Ingredients

## Ingredients

### For the Filling:
- 1 unbaked pie shell (9-inch)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 can (12 oz / 300ml) evaporated milk
- 2 cups pumpkin puree
- 0.75 cup granulated sugar
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 0.5 tsp ground ginger
- 0.25 tsp ground cloves
- 0.25 tsp ground nutmeg


## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg.
2. Add eggs and beat lightly until blended.
3. Stir in pumpkin puree and mix until smooth.
4. Gradually whisk in evaporated milk until fully combined.
5. Pour mixture into the pie shell.

## Baking

1. Bake at **425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes**.
2. Reduce heat to **350°F (175°C)** and bake for **40–50 minutes**, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.
3. Cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving.

> Optional: Top with whipped cream before serving.

## Notes
- You can substitute fresh pumpkin with 2 cups of canned pumpkin puree.
- Avoid overbaking — the center should jiggle slightly when done; it will set as it cools.
